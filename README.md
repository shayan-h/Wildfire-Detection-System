# Wildfire-Detection-System
Developed a wildfire detection system using Python, Pandas, and Machine Learning - used NASA’s database of Fire Information for Resources Management System (FIRMS) to provide first responders with an accurate detection of fires by leveraging weather data and visual confirmation from cellphone users in the vicinity through proximity SMS.
Received NASA’s Best Hack Award out of a dozen project submissions for developing a creative solution to improve wildfire resource management and the safety of rural residents.
Utilized: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, k-means clustering, AI/ML, SMS API, Weather API
